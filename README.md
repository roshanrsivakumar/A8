# Customer Churn Predictor

Hi, I'm Roshan Rajkumar Sivakumar (V01151141), and this is my submission for Assignment A8 at Virginia Commonwealth University.

## What Does This App Do?

This project lets anyone—data scientists, business users, or students—predict whether a customer is likely to leave (churn) using a trained machine learning model. You can try it for just one customer, or upload an entire spreadsheet for batch predictions. The interface is clean, simple, and automatically handles missing info so you don't have to worry about the perfect file format.

---

## How It Works

- You can enter a customer's details (like gender, tenure, and monthly charges) and get a prediction instantly.
- Or, if you have a CSV file of customer records, upload it for batch predictions—results download as a CSV, ready for analysis.
- The app also shows charts that give you a sense of churn patterns—so you can spot trends at a glance.

## Getting Started

**To try this app on your own computer:**

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Install the necessary Python packages:
3. Make sure you have the model file (`simple_churn_model.pkl`) in your folder.
4. Run the app:streamlit run app.py
5. Your web browser will open automatically—follow the on-screen prompts!

## Project Files

- `app.py` — the actual Streamlit web app
- `train_model.py` — for retraining the model if needed
- `simple_churn_model.pkl` — the trained model
- `requirements.txt` — all dependencies for easy setup
- `README.md` — this document

## Why I Built This

I wanted to demonstrate not just how machine learning works, but how it can be made accessible to everyone, not just programmers. By building a simple interface over a predictive model, I learned how to handle real-world messy data, automate repetitive steps, and communicate complex results in ways everyone can understand.

Thanks for checking out my project—and for letting me share not just my code, but my curiosity about what makes customers stay or leave!
